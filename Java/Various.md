# Java Record keyword
* [Reference](https://www.baeldung.com/java-record-keyword)
* Records are **immutable** data classes that require only the type and name of fields. The `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods, as well as the `private`, `final` fields and public constructor, are generated by the Java compiler.
* To create a Person record, weâ€™ll use the record keyword:
```java
public record Person (String name, String address) {}
```
* Using records, **a public constructor, with an argument for each field, is generated for us**. In the case of our `Person` record, the equivalent constructor is:
```java
public Person(String name, String address) {
    this.name = name;
    this.address = address;
}
```
* We also receive public getters methods, whose names match the name of our field, for free. We use the attribute name, such as:
```java
Person person = new Person(name, address);

assertEquals(name, person.name());
assertEquals(address, person.address());
```
* Additionally, an `equals` method is generated for us.
* We also receive a `toString` method that results in a string containing the name of the record, followed by the name of each field and its corresponding value in square brackets.
